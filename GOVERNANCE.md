# Governance (draft)

- UPX Working Group (UPX‑WG): open membership (engineers, manufacturers, community).
- Technical Steering: decisions by lazy consensus; escalate to WG vote if needed.
- Releases: time‑boxed drafts (v0.x) → candidate (rc) → stable (v1.0).
- Conflicts of interest must be disclosed.
